# Mobile Form Flow - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The mobile form flow is now fully implemented and working. When a trainer creates a client from the dashboard and assigns them a form, the client will see and complete that form in the mobile app after creating their account and setting their password.

## Complete Flow

### 1. **Trainer Creates Client (Dashboard)**
**File:** `frontend/app/(main)/clients/create/page.tsx`

The trainer:
1. Enters basic client information (Name, Email, Phone)
2. Selects a check-in form (defaults to the main form marked as `isMainForm: true`)
3. Adds subscription details, labels, and notes
4. Clicks "Create Client Account"

**What happens:**
- Backend creates a `TrainerClient` record
- Backend creates a `ClientAuth` record with:
  - A temporary random password
  - `requiresPasswordReset: true` flag
- No form submission is created (unlike the old flow where the trainer filled the form)
- The client receives their login email and temporary password

### 2. **Client First Login (Mobile App)**
**File:** `mobile/app/login.tsx`

The client:
1. Opens the mobile app
2. Enters their email
3. The backend checks if this is a first login and returns `firstLogin: true` with a special token
4. Client is redirected to the Set Password screen

### 3. **Client Sets Password (Mobile App)**
**File:** `mobile/app/set-password.tsx`

The client:
1. Creates a new password (minimum 8 characters)
2. Confirms the password
3. Submits the form

**What happens:**
- Backend updates the `ClientAuth` record with the new password hash
- Sets `requiresPasswordReset: false`
- Returns an access token
- The mobile app calls `checkFormCompletion()` function

### 4. **Form Completion Check**
Both `login.tsx` and `set-password.tsx` have the same `checkFormCompletion()` function:

```typescript
const checkFormCompletion = async () => {
  try {
    const token = (globalThis as any).ACCESS_TOKEN;
    const response = await fetch(`${API}/mobile/forms/main`, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (response.ok) {
      if (data.completed) {
        // Form already completed, go to main app
        router.replace('/(tabs)/home');
      } else {
        // Form not completed, redirect to form
        router.replace('/form');
      }
    } else {
      // If no form exists, go to main app
      router.replace('/(tabs)/home');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking form completion:', error);
    // On error, go to main app
    router.replace('/(tabs)/home');
  }
};
```

### 5. **Client Completes Form (Mobile App)**
**File:** `mobile/app/form.tsx`

The client:
1. Sees the main form assigned by their trainer
2. Answers questions one by one with:
   - Progress indicator (Question X of Y)
   - Progress bar showing completion percentage
   - Previous/Next navigation buttons
   - Animated transitions between questions
   - Auto-save draft functionality (currently client-side)
3. Submits the form on the last question

**Form Features:**
- ✅ Step-by-step question flow
- ✅ Progress indicators
- ✅ Back button to edit previous answers
- ✅ Animations/transitions between questions
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Multiple question types: short, long, single, multi, date, time
- ✅ Draft saving (auto-saves on each answer)
- ✅ Clean, modern UX design

**What happens:**
- Backend validates all required fields
- Backend checks if the form was already submitted
- Backend creates a `CheckInSubmission` record with the client's answers
- Client is redirected to the main app `/(tabs)/home`

### 6. **Subsequent Logins**
After the form is completed, on subsequent logins:
1. Client enters email and password
2. Backend authenticates the client
3. `checkFormCompletion()` is called
4. API returns `completed: true`
5. Client goes directly to `/(tabs)/home`

## Backend API Endpoints

### GET `/mobile/forms/main`
**File:** `backend/src/routes/mobile-forms.ts`

Returns the main form for the client's trainer.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "form": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Client Onboarding Form",
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "label": "What is your fitness goal?",
        "type": "single",
        "required": true,
        "options": ["Weight Loss", "Muscle Gain", "General Fitness"],
        "order": 0
      }
    ]
  },
  "completed": false
}
```

If already completed:
```json
{
  "form": { ... },
  "completed": true,
  "submission": { ... }
}
```

### POST `/mobile/forms/submit`
**File:** `backend/src/routes/mobile-forms.ts`

Submits the client's form responses.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "formId": 1,
  "answers": {
    "1": "Weight Loss",
    "2": "I want to lose 10kg",
    "3": ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "submissionId": 123,
  "message": "Form submitted successfully"
}
```

## Database Changes

### `TrainerClient` Model
- `selectedFormId`: The ID of the check-in form assigned to this client

### `ClientAuth` Model
- `requiresPasswordReset`: Boolean flag indicating if the client needs to set their password
- When a trainer creates a client with `createClientAuth: true`, this is set to `true`

### `CheckInSubmission` Model
- Stores the client's answers to the form
- Links to both the client (`clientId`) and the form (`formId`)
- `answers`: JSON object with question IDs as keys and answers as values
- `submittedAt`: Timestamp of submission

## Form Builder (Dashboard)

### Creating a Main Form
**File:** `frontend/app/(main)/check-ins/page.tsx`

Trainers can create check-in forms with:
1. Form name
2. Multiple questions with types: short, long, single, multi, file, date, time
3. Mark questions as required
4. Reorder questions via drag & drop
5. **Mark form as "Main Form"** - This makes it the default form for new clients
6. **Publish the form** - Only published forms are shown to clients

### Form Settings
- `isMainForm`: Boolean - if true, this form is automatically selected when creating a new client
- `published`: Boolean - only published forms can be completed by clients

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Create a Main Form (Dashboard)
1. Go to `/check-ins` in the dashboard
2. Click "Create Form"
3. Add questions
4. Check "Set as Main Form"
5. Check "Publish Form"
6. Save the form

### 2. Create a Client (Dashboard)
1. Go to `/clients/create`
2. Enter client info: Name, Email, Phone
3. The "Check-in Form" dropdown should show your main form as default
4. Add subscription details, labels, notes as needed
5. Click "Create Client Account"
6. Note the temporary password shown in the success message

### 3. Client Login (Mobile App)
1. Open the Expo mobile app
2. Enter the client's email
3. Click "Next"
4. App detects first login and redirects to Set Password
5. Create a new password
6. Submit
7. App automatically checks form completion
8. Client is redirected to the form screen

### 4. Complete Form (Mobile App)
1. Answer each question
2. Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate
3. Watch the progress bar fill up
4. Submit on the last question
5. Client is redirected to the home screen

### 5. Verify Submission (Dashboard)
1. Go to `/check-ins/responses`
2. You should see the client's submission
3. Click to view their answers

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Client already completed form**: Redirects to home screen directly
✅ **No main form exists**: Redirects to home screen (no blocking)
✅ **Form not published**: Not shown to client
✅ **Network error during form check**: Gracefully redirects to home screen
✅ **Required fields validation**: Client cannot proceed without answering required questions
✅ **Duplicate submission**: Backend prevents submitting the same form twice
✅ **Expired subscription**: Separate blocking screen already implemented

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/mobile-forms.ts` - New API endpoints for mobile form system
- ✅ `backend/src/server.ts` - Registered `/mobile/forms` route
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/clients.ts` - Added `createClientAuth` flag and conditional form submission
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/checkins.ts` - Added `published` field support

### Frontend (Dashboard)
- ✅ `frontend/app/(main)/clients/create/page.tsx` - Simplified to single-step form with all features
  - Basic client info (Name, Email, Phone)
  - Form selection (defaults to main form)
  - Comprehensive subscription details
  - Labels management
  - Notes management
  - Success redirect to clients list

### Mobile App
- ✅ `mobile/app/form.tsx` - Complete step-by-step form implementation
- ✅ `mobile/app/login.tsx` - Added `checkFormCompletion()` call
- ✅ `mobile/app/set-password.tsx` - Added `checkFormCompletion()` call

## Current Status

✅ **All features implemented and working**
✅ **Backend API tested and responding correctly**
✅ **Mobile form UI complete with step-by-step flow**
✅ **Form completion check integrated into login flow**
✅ **Dashboard client creation simplified and working**
✅ **No linting errors**

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

While the current implementation is complete and working, here are some optional enhancements for the future:

1. **Server-side draft storage** - Currently drafts are client-side only
2. **File upload support** - UI exists but backend needs file handling
3. **Date/Time pickers** - Replace text inputs with native pickers
4. **Form versioning** - Track form changes and only show new versions to new clients
5. **Notification to trainer** - Email/push when a client completes their form
6. **Form analytics** - Dashboard showing completion rates
